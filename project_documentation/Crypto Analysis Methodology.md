Methodology to Achieve Your Objective:
Here's how you can practically and rigorously approach this:
1. Clearly Define Each Event Condition:
	* Write precise, explicit conditions for each event (poor low/high, NVPOC revisit, etc.).
2. Data Preparation:
	* Export data from Sierra Chart (e.g., CSV with necessary fields).
	* Structure and preprocess data (ideally with Python/Pandas).
3. Programmatically Detect Events:
	* Write Python logic that programmatically identifies occurrences of:
		o Poor highs/lows (unfinished auctions)
		o NVPOCs
		o Failed auctions
		o Value areas (VAH, VAL)
		o Initial Balance extremes
		o Single prints
		o ATR/ASR boundary breaches
4. Statistical Analysis:
	* Measure the frequency and timing (in number of hours, days, or sessions) of subsequent revisits or repairs.
	* Compute conditional probabilities for each event:
		o Probability of revisit within various timeframes (e.g., same day, next day, next 48h, etc.).
		o Confidence intervals for robust statistics.
5. Visualization and Interpretation:
	* Clearly present probabilities using graphs, tables, or dashboards.
	* Provide intuitive narratives alongside statistical evidence to guide trading decisions.
6. Validate and Iterate:
	* Validate against out-of-sample data to ensure robustness.
	* Iterate the logic based on your insights to refine probabilities.
